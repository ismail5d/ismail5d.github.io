## Work Experience
**Data Scientist-intern @ StartSafe (_February 2023 - September 2023_)**
- Designed and implemented automated data extraction and transformation procedures, reducing the time spent on data preparation by 40%.
- Incorporated macros and VBA scripts to automate the generation of daily and weekly reports, allowing stakeholders to access real-time performance metrics effortlessly.
- Customized the dashboard to provide interactive data visualization, empowering marketing managers to identify trends and make data-driven decisions for optimizing campaign strategies.

**Data Science-intern @ CNRST (_February 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Fine-tuned pre-trained models (e.g. WAV2VEC) to achieve 83% accuracy in Arabic speech recognition for non-native speakers, particularly children.
- Collected, cleaned and transcribed almost 10000 audio files to fine tune a pre- trained model (WAV2VEC).
- Applied reverse engineering on an existing application to extract audio files.
- Developed an efficient Arabic speech recognition application using deep learning algorithms such as CNN, RNN and Transformers to recognize Arabic alphabet and words.
- Deployed the final model with Unity Engine, Docker and Gradio.
- Presented research findings to stakeholders, enabling the deployment of advanced speech recognition technologies.

## Projects
**Image classification of emotions**
- Collected and cleaned 150GB dataset of images for pre-processing and fed it into a CNN model with 85% accuracy test results.
- Succeeded in linking images of the same person in two separate databases with different emotions or clothes.
- Integrated the model to a company's camera surveillance to keep track of their employees when they enter and when they left the site.

**Sentiment analysis of tweets in real time**
- Classified tweets into 3 categories, whether they are positive, negative or neutral using NLTK library.
- Used twitter streaming API to classify tweets generated in real time.
- Built and compared different models to evaluate the test accuracy on tweets.

**Sales analytics of a supermarket**
- Applied ETL technique on a supermarket dataset with the help of SSIS.
- Designed and implemented a data model that supports the desired sales analysis using SSAS Microsoft service.
- Developed a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard using SSRS tool.
